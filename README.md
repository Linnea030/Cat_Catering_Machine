# Cat_Catering_Machine
Based on Arduino
I developed an Arduino-based cat catering machine. 
There is timing feeder, a toy module, humidity detect module and a note leaving module, 
which can fully help owners to take good care of their pets.
The whole project has four modes. 
The source code is in DDminiproject file.

Here is video for how to use it. 
I uploaded video on Bilibili and YouTube.
